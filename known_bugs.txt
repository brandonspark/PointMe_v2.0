Currently rests upon the assumption that, inside of a struct { }; definition,
there are no curly braces. The c0 reference says there are no unions, so this is
probably fine?

Probably massively buggy with respect to anything that involves newlines or
escaped characters.

#use is currently an "Identifier". Should probably be its own Token.

The line "#use <string>" currently interprets "string" as a Type, not an
Identifier. Additionally, the < and > are LChevron and RChevron, when in reality
the whole thing should be LibLit "string", probably.

Right now, only assuming that lib lits are using chevrons instead of string
lits. This is not right for Parser in demarcate_functions.
